# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the interactive book on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This book explores the fascinating intersection of artificial intelligence and embodied systems, where digital intelligence meets the physical world.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to the field that combines artificial intelligence with physical systems. Unlike traditional AI that operates purely in the digital realm, Physical AI involves intelligent systems that interact with and operate in the physical world.

Key characteristics of Physical AI include:
- Embodiment: The AI system has a physical form
- Real-time interaction: Continuous interaction with the environment
- Sensorimotor integration: Coordination of sensing and action
- Adaptive behavior: Learning and adapting to physical constraints

## Humanoid Robotics

Humanoid robots are robots with human-like features and capabilities. They represent one of the most challenging and fascinating applications of Physical AI.

### Why Humanoid Robots?

Humanoid robots are designed to:
- Interact naturally with human environments
- Perform tasks designed for humans
- Facilitate human-robot interaction
- Advance our understanding of human cognition and movement
